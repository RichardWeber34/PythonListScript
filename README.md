# PythonListScript
This is a little script I wrote up while reading a Python tutorial in order to help me pick up some of the basics. 

Running the main script, ListCreationScript.py, will prompt the user for a few values and create a list of random integers accordingly.
It will print the list as generated, sort it and print again, and then tell the user some things about the generated list.

Two other files are included, one is a QuickSort and the other is the list builder. I could have easily included these in the main file,
but was trying to see how linking multiple files would work and had written the QuickSort before the others so it felt right to leave it 
as a standalone.
